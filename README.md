# Student Space

## Purpose of CSSI Final Project
 The goal of this project is to create a web app that provides students with a centralized place to study and focus alongside with necessary, relevant, and helpful information.

  Students often get pulled in several different directions: from checking their upcoming events, viewing/creating their notes, listening to music, and completing their tasks for the day. Switching between all these applications often impede a studentâ€™s productivity and open opportunities for countless distractions. 

Student Space limits distractions and provides for the most essential needs (Tasks/ToDo, Upcoming events/Calendar, Music, and Notetaking) of a student, all in a centralized location. If needed, there is an Xtreme/No distraction mode with just a notepad as the camera on your device verifies that you are still at your desk.
